    "Supervised learning can be used to classify emails as either spam or not spam. In this example, the algorithm is trained on a dataset of emails where each email is labeled as either spam or not spam.

    "Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning technique in which an algorithm discovers patterns and relationships using unlabeled data. Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning doesn’t involve providing the algorithm with labeled target outputs.

    "n machine learning, the train, test, and validation split refers to the process of dividing a dataset into separate subsets for training, evaluating, and validating a model. Each subset serves a specific purpose in the model development and evaluation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Training Set:\n",
    "   - The training set is used to train the machine learning model. It contains a large portion of the available data and is used to teach the model to make predictions or classifications based on input features.\n",

    "Unsupervised learning can be a powerful tool for anomaly detection, as it allows the model to identify patterns and anomalies in data without the need for labeled examples. Here are several common approaches to using unsupervised learning for anomaly detection:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Clustering:\n",
    "   - Clustering algorithms, such as K-means, DBSCAN, or Gaussian Mixture Models, can be used to group similar data points together based on their features. Anomalies can then be identified as data points that do not fit well into any of the clusters or are located far from the cluster centers.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Density Estimation:\n",
    "   - Density estimation techniques, such as Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) or Gaussian Mixture Models, can be used to estimate the probability density function of the data. Anomalies can be identified as data points with low probability densities, indicating that they are unlikely to have been generated by the same distribution as the majority of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Autoencoders:\n",
    "   - Autoencoders are a type of neural network architecture that can learn to reconstruct input data. When trained on normal instances, an autoencoder will learn to reconstruct them accurately. Anomalies, which deviate significantly from the learned patterns, will result in higher reconstruction errors, making them detectable.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Principal Component Analysis (PCA):\n",
    "   - PCA can be used to reduce the dimensionality of the data while preserving most of its variance. Anomalies may be detected by examining the residuals or reconstruction errors of data points in the lower-dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Isolation Forest:\n",
    "   - Isolation Forest is an algorithm specifically designed for anomaly detection. It works by isolating anomalies in a random way compared to the majority of the data points, making it efficient and effective for high-dimensional datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. One-Class SVM:\n",
    "   - One-Class Support Vector Machines (SVM) are designed to identify outliers or anomalies based on the idea that normal data points lie in a high-density region, while anomalies are in sparser areas. One-Class SVM aims to find a hyperplane that separates the majority of the data from the sparse region containing anomalies.\n"
